# 📚 DyslexEdu – AI Learning Companion for Dyslexic Students

An AI-powered educational platform designed to support dyslexic learners through personalized explanations, adaptive learning tools, and interactive educational assistance.

DyslexEdu combines a **custom TinyLLM language model**, a **Node.js backend**, and a **modern React frontend** to deliver an intelligent learning environment for children with reading difficulties.

The platform helps students understand reading concepts, practice alphabet learning, and build confidence through supportive AI responses.

# 🌟 Project Vision

Dyslexia affects millions of learners worldwide and often creates barriers to reading, spelling, and comprehension.

DyslexEdu aims to create a **safe, supportive, and personalized learning experience** where students can:

- ask questions about reading and learning
- receive simplified AI explanations
- practice alphabet and phonics
- take learning assessments
- receive encouraging responses

The system bridges **Artificial Intelligence and Education** to assist dyslexic learners.

# ▶️ How to Run the Project

The system requires **three services running simultaneously**.

---

# 1️⃣ Run the AI Model Server

Navigate to the LLM folder:

```

cd llm

```

Start the FastAPI server:

```

uvicorn api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

```

This starts the AI service.

---

# 2️⃣ Run the Backend Server

Navigate to the server folder:

```

cd server

```

Install dependencies:

```

npm install

```

Start the backend server:

```

node index.js

```

Backend will run at:

```

[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

```

---

# 3️⃣ Run the Frontend

Navigate to the client folder:

```

cd client

```

Install dependencies:

```

npm install

```

Start the frontend server:

```

npm run dev

```

Application will run at:

```

[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

```

---

# 📡 Example API Request

### Request

```

POST /chat

{
"question": "What is dyslexia?"
}

```

### Response

```

{
"answer": "Dyslexia is a learning difference that can make reading and spelling harder.",
